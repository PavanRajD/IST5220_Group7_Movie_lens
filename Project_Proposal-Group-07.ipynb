    "<p>    The movie industry is experiencing a boom in recent years. A huge number of movies are released every year. The release of each movie, especially when you aren't around to see it, can be difficult to notice. Our business is to analyse past movies and to help users to find movies that interest him. Depending on the ratings of other users, one can infer exactly how good a movie is based upon the other users' opinions. This requires the creation of a proprietary prediction system based on movies released in the past that have created a lasting impression on users and their ratings.</p>"

    "<p>MovieLens is an active research platform that has hosted many experiments since it was launched in 1997, and these datasets are primarily a result of member activity in the system. this in regards explains about the history of the movielens dataset[1]. There has been previous research done on similar scenarios. It is very common for recommender systems to use collaborative filtering (CF) in order to provide personalized recommendations to end users. The User-Item Rating Matrix is applied to CF to identify clusters of similar users. The similarity measurement method is generally used to identify this cluster of users.[2] In spite of its efficiency, collaborative filtering (CF) suffers from the well-known cold start problem, which makes it challenging to determine the preferences of new users. In order to solve this problem, we can use the Ask To Rate technique. This technique involves showing a new user some items and asking him or her to rate them. A kNN algorithm is typically used in Ask To Rate technique to select items.[3]</p>"

Similar movies which were beloved in the past have become disasters in recent years. In what ways are these movies impacting the viewers, and how are they influencing them. We will use this dataset to analyse rating over different genre movies over the years. and will predict how this like towards a genre is changing over time. To conduct analysis and address research questions, the selected dataset includes all of the necessary data."
